<p>UCNets is the University of California Berkeley Social Networks Study, a longitudinal study with the objective of understanding how network composition changes over time as a result of life course transitions - e.g., graduation, marriage, retirement or widowhood - and how these changes are related to health status and outcomes.  Using mostly addressed-based sampling from six San Francisco bay area counties, the study recruited participants in two age groups (cohorts) - 21-30 year-olds and 50-70 year-olds -- to maximize the possibility of experiencing a life transition.  There are 3 waves of interviewing. Two have been completed (winter 2015-2016, and winter-spring 2017) and a third will commence in spring 2018.  In Wave 1, the majority of respondents completed a face-to-face interview, with the rest filling out a comparable web survey. The survey contains items regarding households, personal networks, family milestones, employment, health status and behavior, personality and demographic characteristics.</p></span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> Using an address-based sampling (ABS), potential respondents were sent a letter inviting them to participate in the survey. The letter directed them to call a toll-free number or visit a website to take a screener survey to confirm age group, as well as randomize the selection by age group and within age group. Then qualifying respondents were randomly selected such that 3 out of 4 were directed to a face-to-face (FTF) survey and the others to a web survey.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Longitudinal: Panel</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Adults in two cohorts, age 21-30 and 50-70 years old at the time of enrollment.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> Individual</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> observational data, survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> face-to-face interview, web-based survey</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> Among the older population, the cumulative response rate was about three percent .</span></p>

ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
		        		<h2>Analysis Information:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Weight:</strong> There are two variables for each case. The first weight (variable WEIGHT_DEMO in both datasets) matches the conjoint sociodemographic distributions of six attributes in the sample to that of the six Bay Area counties (using the 2014 American Community Survey) for each age group. The second weight (WEIGHT_DEMO_LOC in Dataset 1) adds to that calculation adjustments for the sampling strata. Other weight variables include WT_DEM_95R (in both datasets) and WT_DEM_99R (in Dataset 1) which represent the variable WEIGHT_DEMO trimmed by 5% and 1%, respectively.</span></p>
